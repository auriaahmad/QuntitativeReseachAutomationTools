    "Abstract: Food security is one of the priorities of every country in the World. However, different factors are making it difficult to meet global targets on food security. Some unprecedented shocks are encumbering food security at the global level. Various interventions have been applied toward food security and artificial intelligence is one of the modern methods that is being used in various stages of the food system. In this paper, the application of artificial intelligence in the whole food production ecosystem ranging from crop production, livestock production, harvesting/slaughtering, postharvest management, food processing, food distribution, food consumption and food waste management is assessed. The objective of this research is to assess the application of artificial intelligence systems in all the stages of food systems. A systematic review was conducted by analyzing 110 articles after the screening of 450 articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results indicated that various artificial intelligence algorithms are being applied to all the stages of the food system from crop/livestock production up to food or agro-waste management.

      "Reason: The paper discusses the development of a decision support system, namely Intelligent Food Quality Assurance System (IFQAS), which aims to automate the human-based decision-making process in quality control of food storage. It combines case-based reasoning and fuzzy logic approaches to provide consistent and systematic quality assurance guidelines for inventory management in the food industry. This application of AI in food waste management is evident in the use of case-based reasoning, fuzzy logic, and decision support systems to improve the quality control process and minimize defects.\n",

      "Reason: The paper discusses the development of an expert system, a branch of artificial intelligence, to control potato storage environments. The abstract and keywords mention the application of AI in food storage, specifically in industrial potato storage. Although the focus is on the control of potato storage environments rather than directly addressing food waste management, the application of AI in this area can potentially contribute to reducing food waste by optimizing storage conditions.\n",

      "Reason: The paper is about the effect of heat treatment on lignification in bamboo shoots, with a focus on physiological and biochemical changes. While it mentions some relevant concepts like ethylene production and ACC synthase/oxidase activities, there is no indication that AI (Artificial Intelligence) was applied or discussed in the paper. The keywords do not include any AI-related terms, such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, or natural language processing. Therefore, this paper is not related to the application of AI in food waste management.\n",

      "The reason is that the paper does not involve the application of AI in food waste management. The paper focuses on understanding oil migration in chocolate and almond products, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor changes in liquid lipid content. While it's an interesting study on food chemistry and confectionery science, there is no mention of artificial intelligence or machine learning being applied to manage food waste.\n",
      "I would tag this paper as \"no\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason is that there is no mention of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the title, abstract, or keywords. The paper appears to be a biochemical and physiological study on the effects of storage temperature and duration on the ripening process of plum fruit, with a focus on ethylene biosynthesis and its role in chilling injury. While AI may potentially be applied in food waste management, this specific paper does not involve AI at all.\n",

      "Reason: Although the paper's primary focus is on developing heuristic algorithms for determining inventory location in a food distribution warehouse, its application is related to AI. The use of computerized systems and expert systems falls under the broader category of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, the optimization techniques employed in the paper can be considered as a form of AI-driven problem-solving. While the specific domain of food waste management might not be explicitly mentioned, the general theme of applying algorithms and optimizing processes to improve efficiency and reduce errors is characteristic of AI applications.\n",
